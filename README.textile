h1. How are you gentlemen _!!_

This module provides an easy way to debug broken code.

h2. What you say _!!_

bc. from great_justice import what_happen
try:
    # ...
except:

Or make it even better:

bc. from great_justice import take_your_time

To get a nice debug log just pass a logger object:

bc. from great_justice import what_happen
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
try:
    # ...
except:
    what_happen(logger=logger)
